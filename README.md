# Disease Prediction based on Symptoms using Catboost

Dataset Link: https://people.dbmi.columbia.edu/~friedma/Projects/DiseaseSymptomKB/index.html

This project aims to predict diseases based on symptoms using the CatBoost algorithm. CatBoost is a machine learning algorithm that uses gradient boosting on decision trees. It is designed to efficiently handle categorical variables and can provide accurate predictions. By inputting a patientâ€™s symptoms into the model, it can predict the likelihood of various diseases and help with diagnosis.
